# AWS Forum Demo 2020

## Introduction

The repository contains the **Terraform** and **Ansible** scripts to showcase the **F5 Automation Toolchain** (ATC).

It uses Terraform to spin-up the infrastructure containing :
 - one or more BIG-IP's
 - one or more Nginx based demo servers

It will then use Ansible and the F5 ATC to do :
 - Declarative Onboarding (**DO**) using BIG-IQ as license server
 - Application Service (**AS3**) deployment
 - The decision based on which AS3 blobs to deploy is based on AWS tags

## Prerequisites

The following things are needed to run the demo
 - make installed on host to run the target
 - terraform installed on host to run the infrastructure part
 - ansible installed on host to run the ATC part
 - local **aws credentials should be available** using the aws cli

    ```
    $ cat ~/.aws/credentials
        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = BLABLABLA
        aws_secret_access_key = BLABLABLA
        aws_session_token = BLABLABLA
    ```
**NOTE:** In order to use dynamic AS3 service discovery (using AWS tags), you need to request a new AWS user with programmatic access and use this one instead of your primary AWS account, which is protected with temporary session tokens.

You will also need to copy setup.change.yml to setup.yml and adjust the file accordingly. Variables that are absolutely necessary are :
 - owner
 - aws.ec2_key_name (make sure this EC2 key pair exists for the AWS region you are targetting!)
 - bigip.admin_password
 - bigiq.admin_password


## Usage

In order to spinup the demo, a Makefile with several make targets is available. The makefile contains the following targets :

| Makefile target | Explanation | Mandatory |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| make plan_infra | Prepare terraform for infrastructure spin-up | Only the first time |
| make deploy_infra | Deploy or update the infrastructure using terraform | When creating new infra from scratch or updating existing one |
| make destroy_infra | Destroy the infrastructure | Only when demo finished |
| make reset_infra | Destroy existing infra and create a new one from scratch | Optional |
| make do_onboard | Use Ansible and ATS DO module to onboard BIG-IP using BIG-IQ | Mandatory |
| make do_unlicense | Use Ansible and ATS DO module to unlicense BIG-IP to release license pool entry from BIG-IQ  | Optional |
| make as3_http_auto | Deploy the AS3 blobs for scenario HTTP with autodiscovery | Mandatory |
| make as3_ssl_manual | Deploy the AS3 blobs for scenario SSL without autodiscovery | Mandatory |
| make as3_waf_manual | Deploy the AS3 blobs for scenario SSL+WAF without autodiscovery | Mandatory |
| make as3_gslb | Deploy the AS3 blobs for scenario GSLB | Mandatory |
| make as3_undeploy | Deploy the AS3 blobs to remove ADC configuration for the application | Optional |
| make ts_cloudwatch | Enable AWS Cloudwatch monitoring using ATS TS module | Optional |
| make ts_graphite | Enable Graphite monitoring using ATS TS module | Optional |
| make ts_beacon | TODO | Optional |
| make install_galaxy_modules | Install necessary F5 Ansible Galaxy modules | Only once |
| make inventory | Generate and store the dynamic inventory file for Ansible based on AWS infrastructure | Optional |
| make clean_output | Remove the build artifacts from Ansible (dynamic inventory and stored ATC JSON blobs) | Optional |
| make generate_load | Create HTTP load on the webservers | Optional |
| make terraform_validate | Validate the terraform scripts | Optional |
| make terraform_update | Update the terraform module dependencies to the latest upstream version | Optional |

## Output:

The output folder will contain :
 - The terraform plan used for infrastructure spin-up
 - The JSON outputs of the ATC actions (both the requests and reply bodies)
 - The generated config file for dynamic inventory generation using *ansible-inventory*
 - (Optional) The result of the dynamic inventory generation using *ansible-inventory*
